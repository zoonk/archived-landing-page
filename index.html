    <h1>Open-source solutions for education</h1>

    <p>
      Everything we do requires us to learn something but learning isn't always
      easy or fun. We want to change that.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're building open-source tools to improve our experience while learning
      things.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learning should be <strong>fun</strong>. <br />
      Learning should be <strong>practical</strong>. <br />
      Learning should be <strong>easy</strong>. <br />
      Learning should be <strong>accessible</strong>. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      By improving how we learn things, we want to empower a new generation of
      makers because
      <strong>if we fix education, then we can fix everything else.</strong>
